    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil and garlic in a large saucepan or Dutch oven until garlic starts to sizzle and turn golden. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and oregano; bring to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until sauce is thick enough for dipping, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool and refrigerate.</li>

        <li>Roll out pizza crust and place on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of hummus over the crust. Arrange sliced peppers and broccoli over the hummus, and top with shredded cheese.

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and cheese is melted in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
